# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signal data using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.py` script implements a machine learning pipeline that preprocesses the data, trains a model, and evaluates its performance. The model is trained to classify objects based on their sonar signal characteristics.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains sonar signals captured from different objects. Each sample is labeled as either a rock or a mine. The features represent the intensity of sonar returns at various angles.
